This beautiful flower stands out for its fresh aroma full of sweet-honeyed nuances when extracted with solvents. The orange blossom has a total of five white petals and a large number of stamens. The flowering of the orange tree develops in what we could consider four main stages. First, the orange flowers begin as small round buds. Little by little these round buds become elongated buds until they begin to open, giving rise to the first aromatic flowers. Finally, flowering occurs and the orange blossoms begin to bloom, developing the petals. As the oranges grow, the orange blossoms begin to fall. In fact, of all the orange blossoms that bloom on the tree, only a small part is the one that survives on it and ends up finally becoming the fruit. Taking as an example the cultivation of Valencia oranges (the most famous and tasty in the world), only about 10% survive, since otherwise the branches of the tree would be unable to support all the weight of the oranges.",
